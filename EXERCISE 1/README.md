Here’s a short summary of Project 75: Photography Contest Ratings.

This project simulates managing and analyzing ratings from a photography contest using 
different Python concepts: 
• Integers: Compute total, average, minimum, and maximum scores. 
• Strings: Generate formatted reports using f-strings. 
• Booleans: Apply a threshold check with compound conditions to decide if ratings 
meet the standard. 
• Lists: Store and modify ratings by adding, removing, and sorting elements. 
• Arrays: Use Python’s array module to hold a fixed-size numeric subset and compare 
sums with the list. 
• Dictionaries: Represent participant records with IDs, names, and scores; update 
and delete records, and calculate the total score across all.
